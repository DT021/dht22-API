* dht22-API
A simple API written in Go for the temperature and humidity dht22 sensor.
It supports GET and POST requests

* Requirements
- Go 1.14 or higher
- MongoDB
- mongo-go-driver
OR
- docker
- docker-compose

* Setup
Due to a [[https://lists.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-dev-public/2019-January/029430.html][license]]
issue many Linux distributions removed MongoDB from their official repositories,
as result it is easier to set up the project with Docker rather
than compiling MongoDB ourselves.

**** Install docker and docker-compose on Arch based distributions
#+BEGIN_SRC
$ pacman -S docker docker-compose
#+END_SRC

**** Get the source code
#+begin_SRC
$ git clone git@github.com:KNaiskes/dht22-API.git
$ cd dht22-API
#+END_SRC

**** Run project
***** Start docker
#+BEGIN_SRC
$ sudo systemctl start docker
#+END_SRC

***** Run project
It will take some time the first time you run this command as it will have to pull
the Go and MongoDB images
#+BEGIN_SRC
$ docker-compose up # You may have to run this command with sudo
#+END_SRC
